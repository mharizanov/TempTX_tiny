Uses ATtiny84 microcontroller and DS18B20 Temperature Sensors

Hardware design is available at http://nathan.chantrell.net/20120225/an-attiny-based-wireless-temperature-sensor/

To use with DS18B20 instead of TMP36, a 4K7 resistor is needed between the Digital 9 and Digital 10 of the ATTiny (Vdd and DQ)
